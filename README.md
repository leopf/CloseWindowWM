# Close Window with Message
Close the currently focussed windows by pressing **Alt+L**.

## Installation
First you need to compile the program or [download](https://github.com/leopf/CloseWindowWM/releases) a compiled version. After that you must add an "errormsg.txt" file next to the executable, containing the error message.
You can insert the name of the process to close by using "[[processname]]" in the "errormsg.txt".

To start the program with the start of the PC you need to insert a link to the application into the autostart folder in the startmenu 
of the user.

## Usage
To use the program you have to simply press **Alt+L**. You'll quickly see that the focussed window will be closed.
